This project leverages cutting-edge NLP and machine learning techniques to create an intelligent book recommendation system. Key areas covered in the code include:

Semantic Search & Vector Database: Implementation of vector search functionality to find books most similar to complex natural language queries (e.g., "a book about a person seeking revenge").

LLM Text Classification: Using zero-shot classification to quickly categorize books (e.g., as "fiction" or "non-fiction") for facet filtering.

Sentiment and Emotion Analysis: Extracting the emotional tone of books to enable sorting and filtering based on characteristics like suspense, joy, or sadness.

The entire system is packaged into a fully functional web application interface built using the Gradio library.
